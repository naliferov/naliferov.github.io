Hi! This is Ocraft Documentation. 
Ocraft (Object craft) is small online platform for developing
simple applications using javascript programming language.

Ocraft gives you ability to build applications by adding and managing
objects which contain javascript, audio, images and etc.

Ocraft now is more comfortable to use on desktop than mobile.


Now let's start with description of basic control elements.

In upper left corner you can see show/hide sidebar button. 
Try to click it several times and you will see the effect.

To the right of show/hide sidebar button you can see blue line. 
This is actually input that is actually command-line interface (CLI) in which you can type commands.
Soon i tell you how to open list of comments.

Under command line. You can see list of Opened objects and list of System Objects.
If you click on one of object of System objects list you.  



Now let's talk how you add and manage your data on this platform.

You can develop your application by just adding your redis credentians from upstash.com service.
For this just register on upstash.com create redis instance and add it to "userCredentians" object. You can find it in Objects list.
